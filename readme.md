### Documentation:
Every push to this repo triggers a build and release pipeline in Azure.
The build pipeline (azureDocker.yml) creates a docker image and pushes it to dockerhub.
Then a release of this node-app is deployed to Azure Kubernetes (deployment.yml).

During the process of building, the file deployment-template.yml gets changed into a file
named deployment.yml containing the current docker image tag.
